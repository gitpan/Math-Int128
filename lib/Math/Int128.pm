=head1 NAME

Math::Int128 - Manipulate 128 bits integers in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Int128 qw(int128);

  my $i = int128(1);
  my $j = $i << 100;
  my $k = int128("1234567890123456789000000");
  print($i + $j * 1000000);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds support for 128 bit integers, signed and unsigned, to
Perl.

In order to compile this module, your compiler must support one of either the
C<__int128> or C<int __attribute__ ((__mode__ (TI)))> types. Both GCC and
Clang support have support one or the other type for some time, but may only
do so on 64-bit platforms.

=head2 OSX Caveat

On OSX, the system Perl is compiled with both the "-arch x86_64" and "-arch
i386" flags. We strip the "-arch i386" bit before building this module,
meaning it is only compiled for the 64-bit architecture. Attempting to use
this module while running in 32-bit mode may lead to brokenness. It's also
possible that this will cause other problems that we cannot foresee.

Note that if you compile this module against a non-multiarch Perl you build
yourself then this will not be an issue.

=head1 API

See L<Math::Int64>. This module provides a similar set of functions,
just C<s/64/128/g> ;-)

Besides that, as object allocation and destruction has been found to
be a bottleneck, an alternative set of operations that use their first
argument as the output (instead of the return value) is also
provided.

They are as follows:

  int128_inc int128_dec int128_add int128_sub int128_mul int128_pow
  int128_div int128_mod int128_divmod int128_and int128_or int128_xor
  int128_left int128_right int128_not int128_neg

and the corresponding C<uint128> versions.

For instance:

  my $a = int128("1299472960684039584764953");
  my $b = int128("-2849503498690387383748");
  my $ret = int128();
  int128_mul($ret, $a, $b);
  int128_inc($ret, $ret); # $ret = $ret + 1
  int128_add($ret, $ret, "12826738463");
  say $ret;

C<int128_divmod> returns both the result of the division and the remainder:

  my $ret = int128();
  my $rem = int128();
  int128_divmod($ret, $rem, $a, $b);

=head1 C API

The module provides a C API that allows to wrap/unwrap int128_t and
uint128_t values from other modules written in C/XS.

It is identical to that provided by L<Math::Int64> so read the
documentation there in order to know how to use it.

=head1 TODO

Support more operations as log2, pow, etc.

=head1 BUGS AND SUPPORT

The C API feature is experimental.

This module requires 128bit integer support from the C
compiler. Currently only gcc 4.4 and later are supported. If you have
a different compiler that also supports 128bit integers get in touch
with me in order to have it supported.

You can send me bug reports by email to the address that appears below
or use the CPAN RT bug tracking system available at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.

The source for the development version of the module is hosted at
GitHub: L<https://github.com/salva/p5-Math-Int128>.
